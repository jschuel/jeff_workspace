This package contains a function that calculates test statistics for comparing weighted histograms.
Test is described in Nucl. Instr. and Meth. A 614 (2010)287 and in Eur. Phys. J. Plus 132(2017)196.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The test statistic is calculated as minimal value of multidimensional function.
Polak-Ribière conjugate gradient method of optimization is used in this version of code.

Structure of package

chicom.py--main function  for calculating test statistic called by user;
total_chiwei_grad.py—calculates vector of direction according Polak-Ribière algorithm;
chiwei_grad.py—calculates gradient of multidimensional function (called in total_chwei_grad.py);
step_size.py—solves one dimensional optimization problem  defined by vector of direction;
total_chiwei.py—calculates basic test statistic for given values of parameters of multidimensional function;
chiwei.py – calculates  goodness of fit test statistic of  a weighted histogram  (called in total_chiwei.py);

chicom_test.py – is used to test the program.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The parameters of the  main program  chicom.py  are the following. All vectors must be of the same size.

- weights_1: 				Total weight of events for each bin in the first histogram. (1xM array)
- weights_sq_1:	 		Total squared weight of events for each bin in the first histogram (1xM array)
- N_1: 							Number of events in the first histogram. (Integer)
- is_normalized_1: 	True if the first histogram is normalized. Otherwise False. (Boolean)
- weights_2: 				Total weight of events for each bin in the second histogram. (1xM array)
- weights_sq_2: 		Total squared weight of events for each bin in the second histogram. (1xM array)
- N_2: 							Number of events in the second histogram. (Integer)
- is_normalized_2: 	True if the second histogram is normalized. Otherwise False. (Boolean)


The output is the following values:

- error:   Error code. 0 if calculations are successful. 
- stat:		 Test statistic
- ndf:  	 Number of degrees of freedom
- iters: 	 Number of iterations run

If error > 0, then all other outputs are None.


List of possible Error IDs:
  - 0: Calculations are successful
  - 1: No event in a bin in both histograms
  - 2: Low statistics in a bin <1
  - 3: Bad initial estimate
  - 4: Too few iterations

Here is an example on how to use the function. The example contains the data used in Test 2 below.
How to use the function:

	from chicom import chicom

	w11 = [9.3018, 22.8871, 122.0670, 51.6786, 46.2622]
	w12 = [0.8026, 7.7173, 142.7876, 27.7087, 28.5724]
	w21 = [68.9455, 213.5029, 898.8528, 397.7258, 419.0171]
	w22 = [108.3022, 229.3163, 3697.7102, 1455.0262,  699.6888]
	N1 = 500
	N2 = 1000
	isnorm1 = False
	isnorm2 = False

	error, stat, ndf, iters = chicom(w11, w12, N1, isnorm1, w21, w22, N2, isnorm2)

The package also includes a test file (chicom_test.py), containing 4 tests. 
Run the shell script (compa.sh) to run the 4 tests. The expected result is the 
following. Note that Test 4 is larger (with 100 bins) and thus the inputs are not displayed.
