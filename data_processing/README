This directory contains tools for generating usable ntuples from h5 files that are generated when completing a TPC scan. 

General use case (follow steps sequentially):

1. python3 generate_ntuples.py <month> <day>

This script uses the functions in ntuple_maker_module.py to pass in an h5 file produced by a TPC scan and output a root ntuple. This ntuple contains base pixel  hit and event level information as a starting point for calibrations. The branches in the output root files are:

event_number
timestamp
npoints #(number of pixel hits in an event)
column
row
BCID
num_clusters
tot
sum_tot

ntuple_maker_module.py separates events that have multiple tracks (clusters) into multiple single track-events using a DBSCANS algorithm. When an event shows num_clusters > 1, this means that the original event, before splitting, was a single event with num_clusters tracks.

1b. Run necessary calibrations

2. Input calibration information into tpcs.prop (from tpc_tools) and generate a tpc_tools ntuple, inputting the output ntuple from step 1

3. Pass the tpc_tools processed ntuple into generate_combined_ntuple.py to make a combined tpc-SKB ntuple to use for background analysis
