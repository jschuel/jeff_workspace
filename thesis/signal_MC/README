To be updated:

signal_mc_exp55.root:

Signal MC is a sample of 5000 B0 B0-bar events from exp 55.
The decay file includes a B0 decaying to a pi+pi- CP mode
The tag side, is a semileptonic B decay going to Dstar e nu
Cuts on B are 5.1 < Mbc < 5.4 and abs(deltaE) < 1

signal_mc_exp55_tight_cut.root:
Same as above except cut on beam constrained mass is
5.24 < Mbc < 5.29
